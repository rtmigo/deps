Command line tool for managing local project dependencies in Python and Flutter.

## Motivation

Developing reusable libraries should be simple. If I have working code in a nearby directory, 
I just want to include it. Skipping the hassle of packaging code for distribution.

So I will probably just do:

```bash
ln -s /pathto/libs/mylib /pathto/projects/myproject/mylib
```

Now `myproject` sees `mylib` as a local directory `./mylib`. I can edit both `myproject` 
and `mylib` while working on the project.

**lnkdpn** automates the creation of such symbolic links, solving emerging problems:

- Portability. To make the links easy to recreate on another system
- Dependencies. If the `mylib` depends on other libraries, they will be symlinked as well
